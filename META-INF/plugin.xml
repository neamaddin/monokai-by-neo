      The Monokai theme as in Sublime text, which I tried to repeat as closely as possible (at least for Python). Not a perfect copy, but better than the rest of the themes for you if you decide to switch to Pycharm after Sublime like me.

  <change-notes><![CDATA[
      First release. I would be glad for constructive criticism, if something is wrong in the theme, write, I will try to fix it.
